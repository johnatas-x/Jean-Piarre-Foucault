## Algorithm Levels

All algorithm levels listed below are **already implemented privately**.  
They are **made public and integrated into the example progressively with each new release**.

### Level 1 *(current release)*
Returns the balls with the highest draw percentage.

### Level 2 *(next release)*
Takes into account the best day of the week for draws.

### Level 3
Considers draw frequency.

### Level 4
Considers the date of the last draw.

### Level 5
Takes “friend” balls into account (correlated numbers).

### Level 6
Introduces weighted scoring.

### Level 7
Introduces machine learning with dynamic weights.

### Level 8
Adds new statistical indicators.

### Level 9
Achieves full AI autonomy.
